abstract: >
  Recently, various studies have been actively proposed to enable the deployment, efficient inference, and training of lightweight large language models (LLMs) in edge device environments.
  In this paper, we measure and quantitatively analyze the inference and training performance of lightweight LLMs across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson platforms.
  The results of this study can serve as a foundational reference for designing edge-intelligent frameworks that provide generative AI services in IoT environments.
