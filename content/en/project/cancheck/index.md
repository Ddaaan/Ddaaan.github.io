## üí° Project Overview
CanCheck is an Android application designed to help visually impaired users identify canned beverages.  
It uses the smartphone camera to detect cans in real-time through an object detection model (YOLOv5), then announces the detected label via TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio output.

## üåü Key Features
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Optimized the YOLOv5 model for mobile to detect canned beverages in real time.  
- **Voice Guidance (TTS)**: Announces the detected can name through speech output, allowing users to identify beverages without visual information.  
- **Dataset Creation**: Built a custom dataset by web crawling and manual labeling using Roboflow.  
- **Model Training**: Trained the YOLOv5 model on Google Colab, optimized and deployed it on the Android app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java, Python  
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Google Colab, Roboflow  
- **Model**: YOLOv5 (Object Detection), Google TTS API
