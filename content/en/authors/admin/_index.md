## üíª I'm Daeun Choi, a Backend Developer.
<br>

I enjoy designing **server architectures and data flows** to provide stable and efficient services for users.  
I mainly work with **Django and Spring Boot**, and I'm familiar with deployment environments using **Docker and Nginx**.

I'm currently majoring in **IT Information Engineering** at **Jeonbuk National University**,  
and working as an **undergraduate researcher** in the Distributed Computing Laboratory.  
My research focuses on **LLM offloading and collaborative inference** between edge devices and servers.

Beyond learning new technologies, I value **sharing knowledge and growing together with others** as a developer.
